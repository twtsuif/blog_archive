谢谢！



我很荣幸今天能和你们一起参加毕业典礼，这里是世界上最好的大学之一。

说实话，我从来没有在大学中毕业，这是我离大学毕业最接近的一次。

今天我想讲我生命里的三个故事。并不是什么大的事件，只是三个故事。



## connecting the dots

第一个故事是把生命中的每一个点都联系起来。



我在Reed大学里读了6个月就辍学了。后来在学校待了18个月，才真正离开。

所以为什么辍学呢？这得从我出生之前开始说起。

我的亲生母亲是一位年轻的未婚的大学生，她决定将我送给其他人收养。

她坚持我必须被受过大学教育的人收养，所以都准备好了，我出生时就会被送到一个律师家庭。

只是在最后一刻，这个家庭想要一个女孩。



所以，在备选名单上的，我的养父养母，半夜接到电话，“我们有一个出乎意料的男婴，你们想要吗？”他们说当然。

我的亲生母亲后来发现我的养母并非大学毕业，我的养父没有高中毕业时，她拒绝签署收养文件。

几个月后，我的养父母答应会供我上大学时，她才慢慢妥协。这就是我人生的开始。



十七岁时，我真的上了大学。但是我天真地选择了一个和Stanford一样贵的学校。

我工人阶级父母的所有积蓄都花在了我的学费上。

六个月后，我看不到大学的价值。

我不知道在我的生命中到底想要的是什么，我也不知道大学如何能帮我找到答案。

而我在这里上学，正在花费父母的一辈子积蓄。

所以我决定辍学，并且相信一切都会好起来的。

我当时十分害怕，但现在回想一下，辍学是我做过的最好的决定之一。

从我辍学那一刻起，我可以不用去上那些我不感兴趣的课程，我可以去听那些看起来很有趣的课程。



这并不是很浪漫。我失去了我的宿舍，所以我只能在朋友宿舍的地板上睡觉，我会去捡5美分的可乐瓶子来购买食物。

每个星期天的晚上，我会步行10多公里到Hare Krishna寺庙，为了吃上一顿好的。我喜欢这样。



我跟随着我的好奇心和直觉，遇到的很多事情都成为了无价之宝。

我给你们举个例子。

Reed大学当时提供了可能是全美国最好的书法课程。

大学里的每个海报，每个抽屉上的标签，都是漂亮的手工书法。

因为我辍学了，没有进修正常的课程，所以我决定上一个书法课。



我学习了Serif和San Serif字体，学习了改变不同字母组合之间的间距，学习了是什么让排版变得伟大。

美丽、历史悠久、艺术的微妙，是科学无法捕捉到的，我发现它很迷人。

当时看来，这些东西在我的一生中没有任何实用价值。

但十年之后，当我们在设计第一台Macinosh计算机时，一切都回到了我身边。

我们将它重新设计到Mac中去，那是第一台拥有漂亮字体的计算机。

如果我当初没有辍学去参加这个课程，Mac可能永远不会有这么多的typefaces或按比例间隔的fonts。

由于Windows只是抄袭了Mac，所以很可能个人计算机都不会有这些字体。

如果我没有辍学，没有去旁听书法课，也许所有的个人计算机都不会有这么漂亮的字体。

当然在大学时，我不可能寻找到这些点之间的联系。但我回顾这十年时，这是非常非常明了的。



重申一遍，你看不到在未来里，这些点会有怎样的联系；你只能在回顾过去时，把他们联系起来。

所以你必须相信，这些点点滴滴会在你的未来中联系起来。

你必须去相信某些事情，你的信仰、你的命运、你的生活、你的因果、或者其他的任何东西。

这个观点从来没有让我失望，我的生活发生了巨大变化。



## love and loss

我的第二个故事关于爱和失去。



我非常幸运，我在生命的早期阶段就找到了我热爱的东西。

Woz和我在20岁时，在我父母的车库里创立了Apple。

我们努力工作得很努力，十年之后，Apple从只有我们两个人成长到了拥有四千多员工和十亿估值的公司。

在第九年，我们刚刚发布了最好的产品Macintosh，我马上迎来30岁生日。



在那一年，我被解雇了。你是如何被你自己创立的公司给解雇的呢？

嗯。随着Apple快速增长，我们雇用了一个非常有天赋的人和我一起经营公司。

大约在第一年，公司运转得很好。

但后来，我们对于公司未来的愿景有了分歧，最终吵了起来。

当我们吵架时，董事会站在了他的一边。

所以在30岁时，我出局了。在公众的注视下，我离开了。

我过去生命中的全部，离我而去，真是毁灭性的打击。



最初的几个月里，我不知道该做什么。

我觉得我让上一代的企业家们失望了，当接力棒传给我时，我把它丢掉了。

我跟David Packard和Bob Noyce会面，并尝试为搞砸的事情道歉。

我在公众面前是非常失败的，我甚至想要逃离这个世界。

但一些事情慢慢地洒向了我，我仍然热爱我所做的事情。

Apple发生的这些，一点都没有改变我的热爱。

我被驱逐了，但是我仍然热爱我做的事情。所以我决定重头再来。



我当时没有察觉，但事实是，被Apple解雇是我遇到过的最好的事情。

成功的沉重感，被重新成为一名创业者的轻松感所取代，把所有事情都看得很轻松。

这让我十分自由，进入了生命最有创造力的阶段。



接下来的五年，我创立了NeXT公司，还有Pixar公司。

和一个很优秀的女人，后来是我的妻子，相爱。

Pixar制作了世界上第一个计算机动画电影“玩具总动员”，现在也是世界上最成功的动画工作室。

随着后来事情的发生，Apple收购了NeXT，我又回到了Apple，我们在NeXT里开发的技术是Apple复兴的核心。

Laurene和我有一个非常美好的家庭。



我非常相信，如果我没有被Apple解雇，这一切都不会发生。

良药苦口，但是我认为病人需要。

有时生活用一块砖砸向了你的头。

不要丢失信仰。

我坚信让我继续前进的唯一因素是我热爱我所做的事情。

你必须找到你热爱的是什么。无论工作，还是爱情，都是这样。

你的工作给你的生活填补了很大的空白，想要获得满足的唯一方式是，做你认为好的工作。

如果你还没有找到你的热爱，请继续寻找，不要放弃。

就像你心中所有重要的事情一样，当你找到它时，你会知道的。

就像任何好的关系，随着时间的推移，只会变得越来越好。

所以继续寻找，直到你发现它。不要放弃。



## death

我的第三个故事是关于死亡的。



我在17岁时，我读到了一个名言，大概是这样的：“如果你把每一天都当作生命里的最后一天，总有一天是对的。”

这句话给我很深的印象，从那之后，过了33年，我每天早晨对着镜子问自己。

“如果今天是你生命里的最后一天，我还想完成我今天本打算做的事情吗？”

当答案连续几天都是“不”的时候，我知道我该做出一些改变了。



想象自己很快就会死去，这是一个非常重要的工具，让我能够在遇见一生的重要事情时做出选择。

因为几乎所有事情，所有的外界期望、所有的荣誉、所有困难和失败的恐惧，这些事情在面对死亡时，只会消失，只留下真正重要的东西。

暗示自己将要面对死亡，是我知道的，在你纠结自己是否失去了某些东西时，避免沦陷的最好方法。

你已经一无所有了，没有理由不去追随内心。



大约在一年前，我被诊断出癌症。

早晨七点半我做了一次检查，清晰地看到了我的胰腺上有个肿瘤。我当时甚至都不知道胰腺是什么东西。

医生告诉我，这几乎是一种无法治愈的癌症，我不应该期望活过3到6个月。

医生建议我回家，把所有事情有秩序地处理好，这是医生对死亡做好准备的准则。

这意味着告诉你的孩子所有事情，把未来十年你想说的话，在只有几个月的时间内说完。

这意味着所有的事情都要搞定，让家庭此后尽可能地轻松一些。

这意味着说出你的再见。



我整天跟诊断结果一起生活。

后来的一天早上我做了一个活组织切片检查。

他们将一个内窥镜插入我的喉咙，穿过我的胃，进入我的肠道，将一根针插入我的胰腺，从肿瘤中提取一些细胞。

手术前我被镇静了，但当时在现场的妻子告诉我，当他们在显微镜下观察这些细胞时，医生们开始哭泣，因为这是一种非常稀有的胰腺癌，可以通过外科手术治愈。

我做了手术，现在感觉很好。



这是我面对死亡最接近的一次，我也希望这会是未来几十年里最接近的。

经过这一次后，我可以比"死亡是一个有用但纯粹是一个概念"时，更准确一点的告诉你：



没有人想要死亡。即使人们想去往天堂，也不会为了前往那里而奔赴死亡。

但是死亡是我们共有的终点。从来没有人逃脱这件事。

但也应该如此，死亡可能是生命中最好的简单发明。

它是生命进化的必经之路。

它将年老的生命清除，来给崭新的生命让路。

你们现在就是新的，但是从现在开始的不久后，你们也将逐渐变得年老，然后被清除。

很抱歉这可能有点太戏剧性了，但确实是真的。



你的时间是有限的，所以不要浪费时间在活得像其他人上。

不要被教条给困住，只接受别人的思考。

不要让其他观点的噪声，淹没了你内心的声音。

最重要的是，拥有勇气追随你的内心和直觉。

它们在某种程度上已经知道了你真正想要成为什么样子。

其他的所有事情都是次要的。



## Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish



我年轻时，有个很棒的刊物，叫做The Whole Earth Catalog全球目录，我这代人的圣经之一。

由Stewart Brand在离这儿不远的Menlo公园创办，用诗意的笔触带给世界。

那是上世纪六十年代末，在个人计算机和桌面出现之前，所以是用打印机、剪刀和Polaroid相机制作的。

它有点像纸质形式的Google，在Google出现的35年前。

理想主义、充满了简洁的工具和伟大的想法。



Stewart和他的团队出版了很多期的The Whole Earth Catalog。

然后当这个刊物完成了它的内容时，他们出版了最后一期。

上世纪70年代中期，我像你们一样大。

最后一期的封底是一张清晨乡村道路的照片。如果你是一个敢于冒险的人，很有可能感觉自己搭乘在这条路上。

在它的下方写着这样一句话：求知若渴，虚心若愚。

这是他们离开时的告别语。求知若渴，虚心若愚。

我自己也总是希望如此。

现在，随着你毕业开始新的生活，我也希望你们也能做到：

求知若渴，虚心若愚。



谢谢大家！

Thank you!

I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. Truth be told, I never graduated from college, and this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories.

The first story is about connecting the dots.

I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out？

It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.

So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: "We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him？" They said: "Of course." My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college. This was a start in my life.

And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.

And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting.

It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5¢ deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example:

Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this.

I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating.

None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.

And since Windows just copied the Mac, its likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later.

Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.

My second story is about love and loss.

I was lucky – I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation - the Macintosh - a year earlier, and I had just turned 30.

And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started？ Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.

I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly.

I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me – I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.

I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.

During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.

In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.

I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle.

 My third story is about death.

When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: "If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right." It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today？" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.

Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything – all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn't even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.

I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and I'm fine now.

This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope its the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:

No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.

Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.

When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960's, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.

Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish." It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.

Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.

Thank you all very much.
